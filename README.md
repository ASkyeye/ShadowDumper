# ShadowDumper
Shadow Dumper is a powerful tool used to dump LSASS (Local Security Authority e) memory, often needed in penetration testing and red teaming activities. It offers flexible options to users and uses multiple advanced techniques to dump memory, allowing to access sensitive data in LSASS memory.

## üöÄ Capabilities
- **Unhooked Injection (Modified Mimikatz Binary)** ‚Äì Utilizes unhooking to inject a modified Mimikatz binary, bypassing EDR hooks and evading detection.
- **Unhooked Injection (Direct Syscalls with MDWD)** ‚Äì Implements direct syscalls for stealthy injection using MDWD, reducing the footprint left behind.
- **Simple MiniDumpWriteDump API** ‚Äì Executes the straightforward MiniDumpWriteDump API method for standard LSASS memory extraction.
- **MINIDUMP_CALLBACK_INFORMATION Callbacks** ‚Äì Uses callback functions for custom handling, offering greater control over the dumping process.
- **Process Forking Technique** ‚Äì Forks the LSASS process, creating a memory clone and avoiding direct access to the target process.
- **Direct Syscalls with MiniDumpWriteDump** ‚Äì Combines direct syscalls with MiniDumpWriteDump, enhancing stealth by avoiding typical API hooks.
- **Native Dump with Direct Syscalls (Offline Parsing)** ‚Äì Leverages direct syscalls to create a native dump with essential streams for offline parsing, perfect for low-noise operations.
